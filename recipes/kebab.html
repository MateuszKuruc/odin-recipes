<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chapli kebab is a minced meat patty widely popular in Pakistan. Mixed with a blend of spices, ground beef is flattened into patties and shallow-fried until the exterior is charred and flavorful. </p>
<p>Serve in a bun with pickled red onions or with a side of pita bread. My raita (yogurt dip) recipe makes a great addition.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>

    <li>1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro</li>

    <li> tomato, sliced into rounds</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Coat a small skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beaten egg in the hot skillet until scrambled and set, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Combine scrambled egg, beef, onion, chopped tomato, cilantro, mint, ginger-garlic paste, coriander seeds, salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl; mix by hand until well combined. Shape mixture into patties. Press a tomato slice into the center of each patty.</li>
